# Turtle-Race
This project is a simple Python-based interactive game built using the turtle graphics module. It simulates a race between multiple turtles, where the user places a bet on the turtle color they believe will win.  The game demonstrates basic programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input handling, and randomization.
